# Car Rental System
Welcome to the Car Rental System, a Java-based console application designed to simulate a real-world car rental experience while helping you strengthen Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. Whether you're a learner or a contributor, this project showcases essential features like customer and car management, rental history tracking, and interactive user flowâ€”all through a simple and intuitive command-line interface.

# Features
Rent a Car
Browse available cars and rent with ease through an interactive console menu.

Real-time update of car availability upon successful booking.

# Return a Car
Seamlessly return rented vehicles.

Automatically updates car inventory and rental history.

# Customer Management
Add new customers to the system.

Maintain and retrieve customer details for future rentals.

# Car Management
Add and manage vehicle details including brand, model, pricing, and availability.

Modify or remove car listings as needed.

# Rental History
View detailed logs of all rentals.

Track rental periods, customer details, and car data.

# Future Roadmap
Planned enhancements to make the system more robust and user-friendly:

# Multi-Customer Support:
Allow multiple users to rent the same car (e.g., via time slots or date-based booking).

# Date-Based Pricing: 
Introduce seasonal or duration-based pricing strategies.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
Implement a Swing or JavaFX-based interface for improved usability and visual appeal.

# Data Persistence:
Integrate file handling or a database (e.g., MySQL) to store customer and rental data permanently.

# Learning Objectives
Strengthen understanding of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Practice modular programming and code reusability.

Simulate real-world software behavior in a simplified learning environment.

# Technologies Used
Java (Core + OOP)

Console I/O

(Optional for expansion): JDBC, MySQL, Swing/JavaFX
